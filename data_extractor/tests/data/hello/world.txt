A "Hello, World!" program generally is a computer program that
outputs or displays the message "Hello, World!". Such a program
is very simple in most programming languages, and is often used
to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language. It is
often the first program written by people learning to code.

It can also be used as a sanity test to make sure that a
computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator
understands how to use it.

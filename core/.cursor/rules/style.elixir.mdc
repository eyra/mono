#Elixir Style Rules

## Alias Rules

### No Alias Grouping

Each alias must be on a separate line. Do not group aliases, even if they share the same root module.

```elixir
# INCORRECT
alias Core.{Repo, DataCase}
alias Systems.Userflow.{Model, StepModel, ProgressModel}

# CORRECT
alias Core.Repo
alias Core.DataCase

# For system modules, prefer a single system alias
alias Systems.Userflow  # Then use as Userflow.Model, Userflow.StepModel, etc.
```

This rule:
1. Makes it easier to see which modules are being used
2. Makes git diffs cleaner when adding/removing aliases
3. Avoids confusion about nested module structures
4. Makes it easier to alphabetically sort aliases
5. Improves maintainability by making dependencies explicit
6. Ensures consistent style across the codebase

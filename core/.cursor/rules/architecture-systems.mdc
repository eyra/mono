# Systems

- A System is a folder in the in the systems folder containing code that implements application concept
- A System is autonomous; containing modals, views, logic, routes, etc
- A System can be used by other systems
- Child systems communicate to a Parent using Signal (see signal-architecture.mdc)

## System Features
Features are opt-in capabilities that can be recognized by files at root level of the system starting with an underscore:
    - Public (`_public.ex`): Exposes the public API of the system for other systems to use
    - Private (`_private.ex`): Contains internal implementation details and functions
    - Queries (`_queries.ex`): Handles database queries and data access
    - Presenter (`_presenter.ex`): Implements view model presentation logic and the Frameworks.Concept.Presenter behaviour
    - Plug (`_plug.ex`): Handles HTTP request processing and static file serving
    - Switch (`_switch.ex`): Handles Signal routing and event interception
    - Assembly (`_assembly.ex`): Handles system component assembly and initialization
    - Routes (`_routes.ex`): Defines Phoenix routing for the system's web endpoints
    - Factory (`_factory.ex`): Provides factory functions for creating test data

## File Roles
Files in a system can have different roles, indicated by their postfix:
    - Model: Data models using Ecto schemas (e.g. `user_model.ex`)
    - Form: Components for data input and editing (e.g. `user_form.ex`)
    - View: Components for displaying data (e.g. `user_view.ex`)
    - Page: LiveView pages (e.g. `profile_page.ex`)

# Annotation System

## Overview

The Annotation system has evolved into a sophisticated semantic annotation framework that serves as a structured "database" for managing complex knowledge representations. While annotations can be connected to the knowledge graph in indefinite ways, the **Pattern system** provides meaningful structural organization and semantic consistency. This combination of flexibility and structure enables both creative knowledge expression and systematic knowledge management across the EYRA platform.

## Purpose

- **Flexible Knowledge Expression**: Annotations can connect to knowledge graph in indefinite ways
- **Structured Semantic Organization**: Patterns define meaningful patterns and structures
- **Human-AI Knowledge Interface**: Natural language bridge for humans to interact with formal knowledge
- **Standardized Knowledge Patterns**: Patterns ensure consistent semantic structures across domains

## The Foundation: Everything Begins with a Statement

The entire knowledge system is built on a fundamental principle: **every piece of knowledge originates from a human statement**. The `statement` field in the Annotation model is the **atomic unit** of all knowledge in the system.

### Scientific Social Platform Vision

The system's statement-centric architecture naturally enables a **scientific Twitter/X-like platform** where every message becomes a knowledge contribution:

#### Core Interaction Model
```
Scientific Tweet → Annotation.Model.statement → Knowledge Graph
```

#### Social Knowledge Interactions
- **Tweet → Statement**: "GDPR compliance reduces user trust by 12% in our study"
- **Reply → Connection Pattern**: Link statements in conversational knowledge threads
- **Like → Consent Pattern**: Express validation of knowledge claims
- **Quote Tweet → Enrichment Pattern**: Add methodology notes, context, additional findings
- **Reply with objection → Rejection Pattern**: Challenge conclusions with counter-evidence
- **Retweet with comment → Review Pattern**: Peer validation with expert commentary

#### Advanced Scientific Social Features
- **Methodology Threads**: Threaded discussions linking experimental design decisions
- **Data Citation Integration**: Direct reference to datasets and papers within statements
- **Peer Review Chains**: Formal review processes as structured conversational threads
- **Consensus Visualization**: Real-time aggregation of scientific community agreement
- **Domain Discovery**: Research domain hashtags (#MachineLearning #GDPR #ClinicalTrials)
- **Evidence Thresholds**: Progressive validation requirements for knowledge commitment
- **Attribution Networks**: Complete provenance tracking from casual statements to formal knowledge

#### Knowledge Flow Architecture
```
Casual Scientific Statement → Pattern-Structured Responses → AI Formalization → Global Knowledge Chain
```

This approach makes sophisticated knowledge capture **as natural as social media interaction** while maintaining the rigorous semantic structure needed for formal knowledge systems.

## Architecture

### Core Models

#### `Systems.Annotation.Model` (Primary Annotation)
- **Table**: `annotation`
- **Fields**:
  - `statement` (string) - Annotation content
  - `type_id` - References ontological concept for semantic typing
  - `entity_id` - Owner authentication entity
  - Standard timestamps
- **Relationships**:
  - `belongs_to(:type, Ontology.ConceptModel)` - Semantic typing via concepts
  - `belongs_to(:entity, Authentication.Entity)` - Entity-based ownership
  - `many_to_many(:references, Annotation.RefModel)` - Polymorphic references

#### `Systems.Annotation.RefModel` (Reference System)
- **Table**: `annotation_ref`
- **Purpose**: Flexible reference system supporting multiple entity types
- **Fields**:
  - `type_id` - References ontological concept for reference typing
- **Polymorphic References** (one of):
  - `entity_id` - References authentication entities
  - `resource_id` - References string resources (deduplicated)
  - `annotation_id` - Self-referential annotation linking
  - `ontology_ref_id` - References ontology concepts/predicates

#### `Systems.Annotation.ResourceModel` (String Resources)
- **Table**: `annotation_resource`
- **Purpose**: Deduplicated string resource storage
- **Fields**: `value` (string, unique)
- **Benefits**: Efficient storage of repeated string values

#### `Systems.Annotation.Assoc` (Association Table)
- **Table**: `annotation_assoc`
- **Purpose**: Many-to-many relationship between annotations and references
- **Fields**: `annotation_id`, `ref_id`

#### `Systems.Annotation.OntologyAssoc` (Ontology Association)
- **Table**: `annotation_ontology_assoc`
- **Purpose**: Direct association with ontology elements
- **Fields**: `annotation_id`, `ontology_ref_id`

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Primary annotation with semantic typing
annotation(id, statement, type_id, entity_id, timestamps)

-- Flexible polymorphic reference system
annotation_ref(id, type_id, entity_id, resource_id, annotation_id, ontology_ref_id, timestamps)

-- Many-to-many association
annotation_assoc(id, annotation_id, ref_id, timestamps)

-- Deduplicated string resources
annotation_resource(id, value, timestamps)

-- Direct ontology associations
annotation_ontology_assoc(id, annotation_id, ontology_ref_id, timestamps)
```

## Advanced Capabilities

## Pattern System: Structured Knowledge Organization

### The Pattern Architecture
While annotations offer **infinite flexibility** in connecting to the knowledge graph, **Patterns provide essential structure** and semantic consistency:

```elixir
defprotocol Systems.Annotation.Pattern do
  def obtain(t)    # Creates or retrieves annotation following pattern structure
  def query(t)     # Builds queries for pattern-structured annotations
end
```

### The Flexibility-Structure Balance

#### Infinite Connectivity + Structured Meaning
- **Unlimited Connections**: Annotations can reference any combination of entities, resources, concepts, predicates
- **Meaningful Patterns**: Patterns define semantically consistent structures for specific knowledge types
- **Domain Consistency**: Patterns ensure annotations follow established patterns within research domains
- **Cross-Domain Flexibility**: New patterns can be created for emerging knowledge patterns

### Pattern Types and Their Structures

#### Definition Pattern
```elixir
%Pattern.Definition{
  definition: "String definition",
  subject: %Ontology.ConceptModel{},
  entity: %Authentication.Entity{}
}
```
**Purpose**: Standardizes how concepts are defined across the knowledge graph
**Structure**: Links natural language definitions to formal concepts

#### Parameter Pattern
```elixir
%Pattern.Parameter{
  parameter: "Parameter description",
  dimension: %Ontology.ConceptModel{},
  entity: %Authentication.Entity{}
}
```
**Purpose**: Organizes research parameters and their dimensional relationships
**Structure**: Associates parameter descriptions with conceptual dimensions

#### Connection Pattern
```elixir
%Pattern.Connection{
  subject: %Annotation.Model{},
  relation: "relationship type",
  object: %Annotation.Model{},
  entity: %Authentication.Entity{}
}
```
**Purpose**: Creates structured relationships between different annotations
**Structure**: Formal subject-relation-object patterns between knowledge items

#### Consent Pattern
```elixir
%Pattern.Consent{
  subject: %Ontology.ConceptModel{},
  entity: %Authentication.Entity{}
}
```
**Purpose**: Manages consent and validation patterns for knowledge claims
**Structure**: Links entities to concepts they validate or consent to

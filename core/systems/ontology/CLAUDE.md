# Ontology System

## Overview

The Ontology system is a sophisticated semantic knowledge management platform that provides formal knowledge representation for the EYRA platform. It serves as the foundation for semantic annotations, knowledge graphs, and advanced research workflows.

## Purpose

- **Formal Knowledge Repository**: Stores AI-formalized concepts, predicates, and logical structures
- **AI Knowledge Synthesis**: Receives and structures knowledge extracted from human annotations
- **Truth Foundation**: Provides formal semantic base for AI-generated knowledge validation
- **Continuous Ontology Evolution**: Grows through AI-driven formalization of human knowledge

## Architecture

### Core Models

#### `Systems.Ontology.ConceptModel`
- **Table**: `ontology_concept`
- **Fields**:
  - `phrase` (string) - The concept phrase
  - `entity_id` - Owner authentication entity
  - Standard timestamps
- **Relationships**: `belongs_to(:entity, Authentication.Entity)`
- **Constraints**: Unique constraint on phrases

#### `Systems.Ontology.PredicateModel`
- **Table**: `ontology_predicate`
- **Fields**:
  - `type_negated?` (boolean) - Support for negative assertions
  - `entity_id` - Owner authentication entity
  - Standard timestamps
- **Relationships**:
  - `belongs_to(:subject, ConceptModel)` - Subject of the relationship
  - `belongs_to(:type, ConceptModel)` - Predicate type
  - `belongs_to(:object, ConceptModel)` - Object of the relationship
  - `belongs_to(:entity, Authentication.Entity)` - Owner
- **Logic**: Implements Subject-Predicate-Object triples with negation support

#### `Systems.Ontology.RefModel`
- **Table**: `ontology_ref`
- **Purpose**: Polymorphic references to concepts or predicates
- **Relationships**:
  - `belongs_to(:concept, ConceptModel)`
  - `belongs_to(:predicate, PredicateModel)`
- **Constraints**: Must reference at least one entity (concept OR predicate)

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Core concept storage
ontology_concept(id, phrase, entity_id, timestamps)

-- Formal predicate logic (Subject-Predicate-Object triples)
ontology_predicate(id, subject_id, type_id, object_id, type_negated?, entity_id, timestamps)

-- Polymorphic references
ontology_ref(id, concept_id, predicate_id, timestamps)
```

## Semantic Capabilities

### Formal Logic System
- **Triple Structure**: Subject-Predicate-Object relationships
- **Negation Support**: `type_negated?` for negative assertions
- **Self-Referential**: All roles reference concepts, enabling meta-relationships
- **Hierarchical Modeling**: Support for subsumption relationships

### Semantic Constants
```elixir
Constants.subsumes     # "Subsumes" - hierarchical relationships
Constants.definition   # "Definition" - definitional relationships
Constants.subject      # "Subject" - subject classification
```

### Example Relationships
```
"Machine Learning" SUBSUMES "Deep Learning"
"GDPR" DEFINITION "General Data Protection Regulation"
"Privacy" SUBJECT "Data Protection Research"
```

## AI-Driven Knowledge Formalization

### The Two-Edged Relationship with Annotations

The Ontology system maintains a **bidirectional, symbiotic relationship** with the Annotation system:

```
Human Annotations → AI Formalization → Formal Ontology
                                        ↓
Human Validation ← AI Annotations ← Ontology Synthesis
```

#### Annotation → Ontology (Formalization)
- **Pattern Recognition**: AI agents analyze annotation patterns to identify recurring concepts
- **Concept Extraction**: Natural language terms become formal `ConceptModel` instances
- **Relationship Discovery**: AI identifies semantic relationships, creating `PredicateModel` instances
- **Continuous Learning**: System improves concept and predicate extraction over time

#### Ontology → Annotation (Validation)
- **Synthesis Presentation**: AI generates annotations describing newly discovered formal relationships
- **Truth Validation**: Humans review and validate AI-synthesized ontological structures
- **Knowledge Refinement**: Feedback improves AI formalization accuracy
- **Collaborative Truth**: Humans and AI together build verified formal knowledge

### AI Agent Architecture

#### Formalization Agents
- **Concept Miners**: Extract recurring terms and concepts from natural language annotations
- **Relationship Extractors**: Identify semantic relationships between concepts
- **Pattern Analyzers**: Discover recurring patterns in human knowledge expression
- **Logic Synthesizers**: (Future) Derive logical rules from validated concept-predicate networks

#### Validation Agents
- **Truth Presenters**: Generate human-readable annotations from formal discoveries
- **Conflict Detectors**: Identify inconsistencies in formal knowledge structures
- **Validation Prompters**: Create targeted questions for human knowledge verification
- **Consensus Builders**: Aggregate multiple human validations for truth determination
